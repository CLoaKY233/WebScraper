# Python Web Scraping Code Explanation

This Python script scrapes product information from Amazon India using the `requests` library for HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing.

## Key Components:

1. **Libraries**: The script uses `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, and `time`.

2. **scrape_amazon function**:
   - Takes search term and number of pages as input
   - Iterates through pages, making requests to Amazon
   - Parses HTML to extract product information
   - Returns a list of product dictionaries

3. **main function**:
   - Gets user input for search term and number of pages
   - Calls scrape_amazon function
   - Creates a pandas DataFrame and saves data to CSV

## How it works:

1. User inputs a search term and number of pages
2. The script constructs URLs for each page
3. It sends GET requests to these URLs with custom headers
4. BeautifulSoup parses the HTML content
5. Product information is extracted using CSS selectors
6. Data is collected into a list of dictionaries
7. Finally, the data is converted to a pandas DataFrame and saved as CSV
